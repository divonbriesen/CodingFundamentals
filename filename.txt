I had to skip lunch because of it, and got no work done for most of the afternoon outside of class. From the time when I left for dinner to when I got back, one of my professors decided to make a new assignment due the next day. By the end of the day, I only got 2 out of the 6 assignments I had wanted to get done that day completed, and to round it off great, I was tired but my brain didn’t want to slow down for me to go to sleep.
